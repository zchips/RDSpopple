This is for the initial push, and will also begin to lay out the scope of this project. 


ideally this project will:
1) allow cross platform sharing between apple music and spotify
2) be a tool that allows audiences to share music to others and their specific music listen platform


Apple and Spotify both have apis that allow for development however, Spotify's seems to be more open and detailed 


right now the plan is for there to be a search bar that allows for a user to enter a songs name, or url and for it to generate the desired platforms link. So I put in a country song for apple music and it gives me the link.

additionally, i want to have state stored in the website so that users can add multiple urls to a 'playlist' and that to be shared and populated from deeplinks


Research has been done and it seems like this can be done, however research and knowledge is scattered so this will hopefully be the origin document
